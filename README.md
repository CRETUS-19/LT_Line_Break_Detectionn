# lt-line-break-detection
Our solution is a smart IoT based software system that detects rural LT line breakages in real time. Sensors connected to a microcontroller measure current and voltage. When a fault or line cut is found, the system sends data to the server, isolates the faulty line and alerts the electricity staff with the exact location.
